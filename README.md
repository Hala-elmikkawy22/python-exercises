# Python Revision 🐍

This repository contains my Python revision codes, exercises, and practice scripts.  
It is organized by topics to make it easy to navigate and review.

## 📂 Structure
- Python basics
- a menu-driven calculator.
- the factorial of a number.
- Find the largest number in the list.

- data structure ( lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets).
- Reverse the list and remove the duplication.
- Hands-on exercises work with strings.
- Code to count lines and words in files.
- Write items to a file and read from it.
- Write data to a file, read it, then copy it to another file.
- Copy a file from a source file to a destination file.
- counts the number of occurrences of a specific word.

## 🎯 Purpose
